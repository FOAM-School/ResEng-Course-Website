This course tries to build (harness) your OpenFOAM skills by getting you involved in programming
new solvers and libraries to solve entry-level reservoir engineering problems (flow in porous media).
The advantage of this particular field is the lack of official OpenFOAM solvers for its problems,
so, you'll have to rely on yourself, and our help, to build capable solvers!
