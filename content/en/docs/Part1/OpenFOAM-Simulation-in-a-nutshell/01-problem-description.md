1. LinuxOne Community is hosted at [marist.edu](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/cloud/), go there to create a free account.
2. I prefer to work on the command line, but many will find an SSH client, like [SnowFlake](https://github.com/subhra74/snowflake), useful.
3. The shell script we use to create the OpenFOAM container is [hosted at Github](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/FoamScience/d661c0b270b940397f5ecd4fa5314015/raw/create-fe4-container.sh).
4. If you don't want to run the commands yourself, you can copy-past them from [My code demo app](https://github.com/FoamScience/CodeDemoApp), 
   (Just hit Ctrl-f and type in the first letters of the lecture title)
5. Go grab the latest version of ParaView from [its official website](https://www.paraview.org/download/) for your 
   platform (I recommend installing the full suite).

### I have my lab set up, now what?

Now, it's time for you to recon your new system!

You should take this opportunity to get familiarized with Github repositories, and go through
this lecture's [individual assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/a6lQhg6d).

#### Should I shutdown the remote machine if I'm not working on it?

Of course you should, but then you have to run the docker daemon when you boot it up again.
