In this modules, we'll (not in this order though, but your call!):

- Set up a LinuxOne Community server to try our light (but possibly parallel) simulations on.
- Learn how OpenFOAM represents fluid flow problems
- Learn how OpenFOAM files are structured.
- Get introduced to few terms we use frequently.
- Browse around OpenFOAM's installation and make a distinction between different versions and forks.

Let's get started.
